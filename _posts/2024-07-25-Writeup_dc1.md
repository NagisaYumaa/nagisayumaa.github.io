![alt text](/assets/img/dc1_netdiscover.png)

target : ``` 192.168.137.141```


i used nmap to see port open 

```terminal
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vvv -p- --min-rate=1000 192.168.137.141
```

*   sC : Enable default script to quick and safe
*   sV : Detect service
*   vvv : increase verbosity
*   p : port to scan "-p-" is all port 1-65535
*   min-rate=1000 : packets are sent < 1000s
