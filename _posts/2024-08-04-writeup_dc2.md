```terminal
sudo netdiscover
```
![alt text](/assets/img/DC-2/dc2_netdiscover.png)
Ip: ```192.168.100.19```

i used nmap to see port open 

```terminal
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vvv -p- --min-rate=1000 192.168.100.19
```

*   sC : Enable default script to quick and safe
*   sV : Detect service
*   vvv : increase verbosity
*   p : port to scan "-p-" is all port 1-65535
*   min-rate=1000 : packets are sent < 1000s
